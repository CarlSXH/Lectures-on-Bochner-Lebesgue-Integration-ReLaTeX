I re-LaTeX'ed these notes during summer when I had nothing better to do. I didn't quite enjoy Bochner integrals when I took the course Math 202a during 2022 Fall at Berkeley. I thought it was too long and tedious just to be general enough to consider a $\sigma$-ring of measurable sets and define the integral for Banach space valued functions. Now that the course is over, I, bare with me while I be a little cringe, sort of got a new appreciation for Bochner integrals. In some sense it's similar to how people first see the definition of a limit: even though it's long and convoluted, it's the bare minimum necessary to define the concept. In any case, this note took me way too long and way too many sleepless nights to complete, but I do feel like I learned a lot about LaTeX in general, so I wouldn't say that this is a complete waste of time.
